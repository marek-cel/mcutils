 * \mainpage mcutils - Utilities Library
 *
 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * mcutils is a modern C++ utilities library providing a collection of reusable
 * components for scientific, engineering, and general-purpose applications.
 * The library is modular, well-documented, and designed for performance and
 * ease of use.
 *
 * \section modules_sec Modules
 *
 * The library is organized into the following modules:
 *
 * \subsection geo_mod Geodetic (geo)
 * Utilities for geodetic computations, including:
 * - Earth-centered Earth-fixed (ECEF) coordinate transformations
 * - Ellipsoid and datum definitions (e.g., WGS84, Mars2015)
 * - Map projections (e.g., Mercator)
 * - Geodetic conversions and calculations
 *
 * \subsection log_mod Logging (log)
 * Logging utilities for:
 * - Console and file logging
 * - Configurable verbosity levels
 * - Stream-based and custom logger implementations
 *
 * \subsection math_mod Math (math)
 * Mathematical utilities, including:
 * - Vector and matrix classes (with and without units)
 * - Quaternions and rotation matrices
 * - Numerical integration (e.g., Runge-Kutta)
 * - Interpolation tables and statistical functions
 * - Angle and coordinate representations
 *
 * \subsection misc_mod Miscellaneous (misc)
 * Miscellaneous utilities, such as:
 * - String manipulation and formatting
 * - Input validation and checking
 * - Helper functions for common programming tasks
 *
 * \subsection physics_mod Physics (physics)
 * Physics-related utilities, including:
 * - First-order inertia and dynamic system models
 * - Physical constants and unit conversions
 *
 * \subsection time_mod Time (time)
 * Time and date utilities, such as:
 * - Date/time structures and arithmetic
 * - ISO-8601 formatting and parsing
 * - High-resolution timers
 *
 * \subsection xml_mod XML (xml)
 * XML parsing and writing utilities, including:
 * - XML document and node manipulation
 * - Reading/writing structured data from/to XML files
 * - Helper functions for common XML operations
